The Dubins path is commonly used in the fields of robotics and control theory as a way to plan paths for wheeled robots, airplanes and underwater vehicles.
This code simulates a missile planning to hit a jet aircraft with Dubin's path planning. 
I created a simulation by making changes to the modeling created by Atsushi Sakai. It is aimed to help understand the subject.
